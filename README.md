# National Parks Reservation Site

We've been asked to develop a command line driven application that our National Park Service can use to book campsite reservations.

### Application 

1. As a user of the system, you can view a list of the available parks in the system, sorted alphabetically by name.
2. You can select a park that your customer is visiting and see a list of all campgrounds for that available park.
3. You have the ability to select a campground and search for date availability so that you can make a reservation.
  a. A reservation search only requires the desired campground, a start date, and an end date.
  b. A campsite is unavailable if any part of their preferred date range overlaps with an existing reservation.
  c. If no campsites are available, it indicates that there are no available sites and asks if you would like to enter in an alternate date range.
  d. The TOP 5 available campsites are displayed along with the cost for the total stay.
  e. If a date range is entered that occurs during the park off-season, then you would not see any campsites available for reservation.
4. Once you find a campsite that is open during the time window you are looking for, you have the ability to book a reservation at a selected campsite.
  a. A reservation requires a name to reserve under, a start date, and an end date.
  b. A confirmation id is presented once the reservation has been submitted.
5. You have the ability to select a park and search for campsite availability across the entire park so you can make a reservation.
6. You have the ability to see a list of all upcoming reservations within the next 30 days for a selected national park.
